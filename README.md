# DestructibleMap
A destructible map made possible with the help of the wonderful Marco Prado and his work. <br> 
You can find his at <br>
https://github.com/marcoprado17/Unity3d-WormsDestructibleTerrain<br>
or his blog<br>

I've been trying to improve upon it.
A few things such as
 - allowing other sprites to be used with his code.
 - (WIP) allowing other shapes/sizes to be used as damage rather than<br>
   hard coding a circle as shape.
